# Hershberger Lab joins the new USAID Climate Resilient Cereals Innovation Lab

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) announced today that it has funded a new $22 million project to support the development of climate resilient cereals.
The Hershberger Lab will support this project through the development of low cost, high(er)-throughput phenotyping of grain nutritional quality using spectroscopy-based methods.
We will be hiring a postdoctoral research associate in collaboration with the [Rife Lab](https://www.rifelab.org).
