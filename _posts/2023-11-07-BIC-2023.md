# Hershberger Lab attends biannual BIC meeting
The [Bean Improvement Cooperative (BIC)](http://www.bic.uprm.edu) is a collaborative organization focused on advancing bean production globally by facilitating the exchange of information, research, and resources.
Members of the Hershberger lab traveled up to Greenville, South Carolina this week for the [BIC and North American Pulse Improvement Association (NAPIA) biannual meeting](https://www.clemson.edu/cafls/bic-napia/index.html) hosted by Clemson.

The meeting was a great opportunity for us to meet with collaborators from across the country in person, which is always a treat. Looking forward to the next meeting hosted by the University of Nebraska!
