<p>The Hershberger lab was featured in an article published today in the Post and Courier: <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/news/sc-gardeners-trove-of-seeds-could-play-a-part-in-combating-climate-change-disease/article_79d4b4fa-69e5-11ed-89c1-2f90eb6be0bb.html">SC gardener’s trove of seeds could play a part in combating climate change, disease</a>.</p>

<p>Over the course of the past sixty years, Mr. Carold Wicker of Prosperity, South Carolina, has collected and maintained these and other vegetable seeds from the Dutch Fork region of the state. Last month, Historian and University of South Carolina distinguished professor Dr. David Shields and Nat Bradford of Bradford Family Farm in Sumter, SC visited Mr. Wicker at his home to sample the seeds and stories Mr. Wicker has been saving. They collected a small number of seeds from each variety to add to the <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/public/seed/heirloom.html">Bradshaw Heirloom Collection</a> at Clemson’s main campus, where they will be maintained and distributed by the South Carolina Crop Improvement Association.</p>

<p>We are honored to have been entrusted with six butter bean varieties from the the Carold Wicker Heirloom Edible Plants Collection and eight more from the Bradshaw Collection. Last week, we planted these and over 300 other diverse butter bean accessions in the greenhouse to produce seed for future field trials and breeding efforts. Stay tuned as we explore these and other Southeastern butter bean heirlooms!</p>

<p>The Sweet Corn Coordinated Agriculture Project (<a href="https://www.sweetcorndevelopment.org/sweet-cap.html">SweetCAP</a>), is a USDA NIFA-funded, multi-institution and multi-disciplinary effort to support sweet corn improvement across the US. Earlier this year, a second iteration of SweetCAP was selected for funding through the Specialty Crop Research Initiative.</p>

<p>Throughout the project, the Hershberger lab will work closely with Dr. Marcio Resende and his <a href="https://www.resendelab.com/">University of Florida sweet corn breeding program</a> to develop and test genomic and phenomic resources and tools for use by the wider sweet corn community.</p>

<p>This week, the SweetCAP team met in person at the <a href="https://www.sweetcorndevelopment.org">International Sweet Corn Development Association</a> annual meeting in West Palm Beach, Florida, to share research updates, tour a field site and packaging facility, and hear from stakeholders.</p>

<p>We will soon be recruiting a postdoc for this project, so please reach out if you are interested in joining the team!</p>

<p>Tyler received his B.S. in Biology from Francis Marion University in Florence, South Carolina. Most recently, Tyler was an Agricultural Research Assistant with the USDA and Clemson at the Pee Dee REC. Over the past year, he has gained experience in fieldwork, lab-based, and plant breeding activities.</p>

<p>Tyler hit the ground running in the middle of field season and is quickly learning the ropes. We’re glad to have him on board!</p>

<p>The Hershberger lab has started efforts towards building a butter bean (<em>Phaseolus lunatus</em>) breeding program. Butter beans, for those of you not from the Southern US, are also known as Lima beans. While <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockYuck#:~:text=he%20tries%20it.-,Lima%20beans,-%3A">Lima beans have become a trope</a> elsewhere, for many South Carolinians these beans evoke more positive memories: shelling beans with Grandma on the front porch, summer family meals, and plenty of bacon fat. What do butter beans bring to mind for you?</p>

<p>Here in June and July in South Carolina, butter beans are harvested green. Our team recently had the opportunity to visit a large butter bean operation in Lumberton, North Carolina (about an hour north of us). Packhouse Farms has been growing butter beans for decades and has developed quite the growing and processing operation.</p>

<p>This summer, the Hershberger lab is putting in the leg work to learn the ins and outs of butter bean production and processing. We are sharpening our pollination skills, gathering germplasm, and setting up our protocols and lab space for the coming influx of beans. If anyone has an heirloom or favorite variety of butter beans, send some our way so we can try it out!</p>

<p>Are you a butter bean grower in the Southeast? We would love to visit your operation! Please reach out if you would be willing to partner in shaping the future of butter beans.</p>]]></content><author><name>Jenna Hershberger</name></author><category term="butter beans" /><category term="announcement" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s official - we have decided on our first crop!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mobile spectrometer considerations</title><link href="/HershLab.org/2022/05/15/spectrometers.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mobile spectrometer considerations" /><published>2022-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-21T22:26:35+00:00</updated><id>/HershLab.org/2022/05/15/spectrometers</id><content type="html" xml:base="/HershLab.org/2022/05/15/spectrometers.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="-context"><i class="fas fa-seedling"></i> Context</h1>
<p>Maybe you’ve read about mobile spectrometers in the latest issue of your favorite journal, or maybe the lab down the hall can’t stop talking about them at the department coffee hour. Regardless of how you first heard about them, mobile near-infrared spectrometers can seem too good to be true. Can you really predict the quality of your grain, fruit, or root non-destructively and without investing in a benchtop spectrometer that costs more than a brand new car?</p>

<p>The answer is, of course, <em>it depends</em>. Which traits are you interested in predicting? What is your required accuracy and precision? Is there existing literature that successfully predicts your trait of interest with near-infrared spectroscopy? How much time are you willing to invest in protocol development? Do you have access to model training software or the coding skills to use a free R package? Do you have a plan for managing your data?</p>

<p>And on top of these, there are spectrometer-specific questions to ask as well: What is your budget? Do you already have access to a laboratory-grade benchtop spectrometer through a collaborator or shared equipment at your organization? Given that most mobile spectrometers have more limited spectral ranges, can your trait of interest be predicted within the range measured by your desired mobile spectrometer (a brief literature search may give you a ballpark to aim for)? Is shipping available to your area? Can you get it in time for your planned experiment?</p>

<p>Consider yourself warned – model development can take a lot of time and effort. If you’re short on time but flush with cash, you may want to consider using a more expensive spectrometer or another method entirely. If you’re committed to the mobile spectrometer train, decide on your plan of attack early. Conduct a few pilot experiments to get your methods nailed down. Trust me, it’s worth the upfront effort to avoid wasting time and resources with your full-scale data collection.</p>
