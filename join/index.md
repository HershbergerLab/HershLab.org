### [We're hiring!](http://apply.interfolio.com/145696)

Together with the [Rife Lab](https://www.rifelab.org), we are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to join our team as part of the USAID Feed the Future Climate Resilient Cereals Innovation Lab (CRCIL). The position will oversee the development and implementation of phenotypic and phenomic data collection and analysis strategies in breeding programs to facilitate improved cereal crop resiliency to abiotic and biotic stress in vulnerable production regions across the world.

The postdoctoral fellow is expected to work closely with international partners including designated National Agriculture Research Institute (NARI) breeding hubs positioned in African, Caribbean, and South Asian countries. As such, extensive international travel to these partner institutions is expected to maximize research and cultivar development output, as well as support training in these areas. Four cereal crops of focus in CRCIL include millet, rice, sorghum, and wheat.

The postdoctoral fellow is expected to contribute a major portion of time toward developing and implementing tools and methods to support germplasm enhancement activities. Such responsibilities include but are not limited to: (1) Breeding program evaluation (2) Digitizing breeding data collection (3) Breeding pipeline optimization (4) Training and support (5) Development and validation of new breeding tools,

The postdoctoral fellow will work closely with multi-institutional project teams in genomics, genome editing, product profile development, nutritional characterization, and crop modeling to effectively make advances in the identification and delivery of important genes and alleles that improve the ability of cereal crops to produce quality grain under harsh environmental conditions. Key U.S. collaborations in CRCIL include Kansas State University (project lead), Clemson University, Cornell University, Breeding Insight, Delaware State University, Louisiana State University, and the University of Florida.

### **Interested? [Apply online](http://apply.interfolio.com/145696) by May 29, 2024 for full consideration.**


We would also be happy to work with you to submit a fellowship proposal to programs such as the [NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Biology](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/postdoctoral-research-fellowships-biology-prfb) or the [USDA NIFA AFRI Education and Workforce Development](https://www.nifa.usda.gov/grants/programs/afri-education-workforce-development).
Submission and proposal information and deadlines vary by program, so it is highly recommended that interested individuals check the respective program websites frequently.
If you are interested in applying for a fellowship, send your CV, cover letter, contact information for three references, and an outline of your proposal to Jenna Hershberger at [jmhersh@clemson.edu](mailto:jmhersh@clemson.edu).
Please do this well in advance of the proposal deadline so that we have adequate time to prepare a competitive proposal.

# Graduate Students

Available MS and PhD assistantships will be posted on the Clemson [Plant and Environmental Sciences Assistantship Openings](https://www.clemson.edu/cafls/plant-environmental-sciences/students/assistantships.html) site.
Typically, graduate students will reside in Clemson, SC for the first year of the graduate program to fulfill course requirements.
Primary field and laboratory research will take place at the Clemson Pee Dee Research & Education Center, a 2,300 acre site located in Florence, SC that is positioned in the heart of South Carolina agriculture.

As members of our group, graduate students will gain knowledge in plant breeding, quantitative genetics, and data science.
Collaborations across multi-disciplinary research groups will be expected, as will the pursuit of support from intramural or extramural fellowships.
Both formal and informal training will be provided through group and individual meetings, conference and workshop attendance, and interactions with others in the lab and department.

To apply, email a CV and a brief description of experience and career goals to Jenna Hershberger at [jmhersh@clemson.edu](mailto:jmhersh@clemson.edu).
