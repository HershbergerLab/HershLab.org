## Expanding the digital ecosystem for high-dimensional phenotypes in plant breeding

![Project overview figure](images/research/dsfas-hdp.png)

High dimensional phenotypes (HDPs) are promising tools for the advancement of diverse biological research, especially in plant breeding and genetics. HDPs, also known as “omics” data, encompass a variety of data types, such as spectral, metabolomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and microbiome metagenomic data. HDPs share a characteristic structure in which each observation is comprised of an annotated vector of sub-observations (e.g., individual metabolite abundances for metabolomics). This complex structure poses challenges for HDP storage, transfer, and analysis. To fully realize the potential of HDPs for crop improvement, it is essential to develop tools that enable plant breeders to manage and integrate new HDP data types with traditional plant breeding data. Armed with these tools, plant breeders will be better able to develop improved plant varieties for food, fiber, and fuel.

This project aims to increase the accessibility of HDPs for plant breeding programs. HDPs, or omics data, are powerful tools that inform our collective knowledge of biological processes and enable more efficient plant breeding selection decisions. To further the utility of HDPs for routine use in plant breeding programs, these data must be clearly structured, easily accessible, and fully integrated with other data types. The development of HDP BrAPI endpoints and BrAPI-enabled collection, management, and analysis tools will enable the efficient handling of HDP data across diverse plant breeding and research programs.

## Approach

1. Generate appropriate data models for HDPs (spectral, transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic, and microbiome data) that accurately represent data structure and associated metadata for plant breeding and genetics use cases.
2. Develop BrAPI standards to efficiently handle HDPs based on the data models for each data type.
3. Design and implement HDP storage structures in BrAPI-enabled breeding databases.
4. Integrate HDP BrAPI calls into widely-used plant breeding data collection tools.
5. Develop HDP BrAPI-enabled analysis applications (BrAPPs) that integrate omics and other plant breeding data types.
